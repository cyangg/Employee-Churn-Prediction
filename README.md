# Employee Churn Prediction

#### This is a side project I did before, the dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data?datasetId=656&sortBy=voteCount) and here are the 5 questions I wanted to solve. Question #1 - #4 were solved by [MySQL](https://github.com/cyangg/Employee-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Employee_Churn_Rate.sql) and #5 by [Python](https://github.com/cyangg/Employee-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Employee%20Churn%20Rate.ipynb).
#### 1. Yearly turnover/churn Rate
#### 2. Top 10 turnover stores, top 10 city.
#### 3. Gender & Age.
#### 4. Most popular termination reason.
#### 5. Stakeholder want to forecast next 2 month employee churn.
